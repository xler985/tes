First Starting section of Next Sess

-Get group outta there and make a perception check to spot Limelight agents
-Lazilo is gonna freak out on what kinda happened and how fast things pop off and she is gonna ask for some time to ‘chill’ aka talk to her patron.
-Probe some question out of Lucki and get some answers and/or interrogation.
-Limelight, after seeing that encounter, is going to use the truffle pig approach and watch from afar while this team seeks out the source of infection (Tor’ Akil and its mental thralls)
-Tok Akil is going to require 7 days to get the required amount of brains in order to open the fabric and punch open a hole between planes into the Astral plane for reinforcement.
-Tor Akil and his goal is going to have varying level of success based on the party’s actions and its actions: 
*Take control of 7 brains for a fully established psychic net.
**Coerce, manipulate, and control various students and staff via clubs or college orgs aka have Tok Akil infect various animals to get long-term (at least a day) influence on students throughout the college. (7x)
*Fully replicate the brain gestalt machine to make the links between human and illithid brains compatible and sync.
**Utilize students or personally infiltrate Rebecca Rossi’s lab to obtain schematics, materials, and educated labor to create a rudimentary gestalt machine. (1x but particular difficult and must be obtained first)
***Materials Source: Drone club, Medical Clinic, and Construction equipment (Check storage warehouses on campus for off-season equipment). (3x required)
***Design Source: The Research Tower
***Educated labor: Campus Services staff
*Perform the ritual of Planar Gate to punch open the gate to Astral Plane for reinforcement.
**Requires the above as well as certain environmental conditions including an isolate location to prevent interference (the ritual will cause a very noticeable psychic field with headaches and nosebleeds immediately felt in the surrounding area) as well as a central ritual location.
*Optional: Obtain the X-Sample to recover Tor’s ‘siblings’
-Tor Akil’s main spell is Psychic Breach, which is an advanced form of mind control. Creates a non-permanent host to siphon FP within 100 ft., allows a much easier success to utilize mind control spells (+5), and these spells can affect multiple target simultaneously if within proximity of one another. Can be broken with a restoration spell or 48 hours of isolation from Tor Akil (10 feet). Can only be attempted 3 times per day and requires a full hour of concentration to make an attempt.
-Obviously each day will consist of the attempts made by Tor Akil and each day, rumors will be heard on campus and both the party and Limelight are going to take actions to further their agendas.
The party must identify these goals and impede them before it’s too late and each day, several rolls will be made to determine how successful Tor Akil is in obtaining these goals.

Cresthaven Classes
-Structure wise for players, the players are going to attend classes. Obviously their grades hardly matters but these classrooms are an excellent place for information gathering and learning of rumors throughout the days ahead. Players during the day can plan to do the following:
*Pay attention to classes: Depending on subject matter, they can get small temp bonuses to certain skills relevant to the material they learned. If they do particularly well (+3 success), they get discounts on purchasing the relevant skill in the future.
*Gossip: By gossiping and prying information via rumors, popular news, and relevant topics, they can gain information not only the world but the campus and its events. This will be very important as events ramp up and Tok Akil makes its moves.
*Ditching class: Players can make use their time outside of classes to perform actions such as B&E, shadowing, or simply spending time recovering. While this action is convenient for these mercenaries, you will have less connection with students and as days go by, suspicion on players will grow heavily as professors, students, and eventually security will begin to look into your status as students and peel back the fake documents and grades used to place you here.

Cresthaven at Night
-While Tok Akil may perform some actions at night, his most vulnerable operations will be done at night under less watch and the guise of chaotic college students. 
-He will chose particular events on certain days based on resources he has gained during the day and relevance for his projects. The POS need to learn to anticipate and intercept these plans before they come into full fruition.

Rumors Day by Day

-Day 1: Tor Akil attempted to obtain a host with Lucki but was interrupted by the POS at the sorority party. He attacks the POS and loses one of his first brain subjects. Still attached to Eris Rossi’s pet ferret atm. Now aware of opposing presence but unaware if retaliation is due to missing student or ‘contamination’.
*Rumors: Party goers say that both students from the Sorority and several constructs were fighting in the upper levels of the Kappa Omega Kappa sorority which ended in a flashbang going off in the upper floors and scattering the party. 2 students were placed in the hospital due to broken arm and hands, obviously fighting. Current conspiracy is that the Rossi Family and the Transistor Family are seeking to openly oppose each other and might seek to be the battleground for another minor family feud between the two families.
-Day 2: Tor Akil will attempt to spy on the members of the party they saw actively fight back during the day, take a member of security staff at the research lab, and steal the design plans at night.

Tor Akil Timeline
-The Levitte Family stages a raid on Project Oleseta, releasing various test material including the X-Sample onto the streets of Neo-Vorkuta. The raid goes poorly as security forces pinned the Levitte family for some time and many documents and research materials are able to escape at this time.
-Sales of various small inconsequential materials are sold throughout the black market during this time and distributed throughout the continent: 
*Arcadia: Grabbed advanced genetic splicing to allow ideal genetic combination based on animilian properties. (Think Animal-Man but on a person) 
*Gnomilian: Acquired advanced AI-Humanoid integration neural mess, allowing a symbiosis of man and AI.
*Sakalhan: Acquired advanced cybernetic nanodes that allow for full body cybernetic conversion of many major organ functions including heart, lungs, limbs, and nervous system. Issue is that the humanoid brain is not able to handle intense neural load and often creates issues of psychosis. 
*Theocracy of Abbasaid: Advanced genetic manipulation of skin pigmentation, allowing arcane runes and symbols to be generated directly via subject’s DNA. Allows for innate magic capabilities and fueled by cellular energy primarily. Particular dangerous when paired by genetic regeneration abilities such as werewolf regeneration.
*Kakarum: Advanced weaponry based on the transmission of both plasma and hard light refraction (Laser weapons and swords lol, closer to the Covenant weapons than Star Wars)

-A sale of the X-Sample was planned at the Gala between Limelight and supplier who was able to procure the sample from the raid. However, the Levitte Family was able to intercept, damaging the case and forcing Limelight to extract out of the city into Limelight mid-level exec Forgot-First-Name Rossi’s personal estate for safekeeping. The sample was also kept here to use as a bargaining chip against other Limelight execs to advance up the corporate ladder against his others. Tiffany’s friends were corporate agents for Limelight and we unfortunately compromised at the time, being placed in temporal status pods but are still infected. 

-During the containment process, Eris Rossi’s pet ferret was able to enter the containment site and became infected a singular tadpole named Tor Akil and was able to escape containment as a result. He is on his own looking to advance his peers’ goal of conquering New Terra for the privilege of becoming demigods in the Inland Empire. Moving from Eris to others, he needs to open a portal for reinforcement and infect others. However, he is isolated from his peers and cannot infect others quite yet so he requires to mentally manipulate others to open the planar gate to acquire communication and reinforcement.
