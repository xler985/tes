Hi Michelle, looks like you graduating now finally! Honestly, I'm proud as hell for you, we've gone through so much from childhood to now and I can't believe you've finally grown up to be such a smart and amazing person. I'm super happy for you, your accomplishments, and finally getting that degree :). I'm sorry I can't be in Georgia rn with the family but let me put on Mom and Dad and see what they have to say, love ya sis:
