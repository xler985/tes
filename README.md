[SCENE: The ashy skies glow a faint red, illuminated by the fires and smoke below. The screams of men and woman alike are only drowned out by the clash of steel and the horns of war. Banners of Emerald and Gold burn in the distance, fluttering ever so proud before its own demise.]

[At the foot base of the mountains, 5 shadows stand atop a foothill, peering in the pit of agony below themselves, the former city of Vokutalastra]
[The Shadow, adorned with ebony metals and steel chains speaks first. A figure with a helm of night and surrounded by a fabric of moonlight, speaks through crackling lips]
Deathless: Look at them. I was told that men feared death. Run from it like chickens without heads. But  now they seek their own end with abandon and glee. Strange. Hm, more for the mausoleum. 
[A figure of sparkling hue speaks next: a diminutive being wrapped in colors of all compositions and an aura of neurotic joy interjects.]
Delirium: Is ThIs GlEE? I’Ve NevEr SeEn ThiS type of HapPinNeSs? It’S…….CraAzy, haAHah… HA…. You guys are nO Fun.
[A shadow stands centered to their circle. A being wrapped in a cloak of mist and faint starlight quietly pleads, whose words are still but carry the force of titans speak.] 
Destiny: How can we abandon them, their race still has so much to give, we can still help them! My kin, this is their hour of most need, they have no one to guide them. They are as lost as the lamb that fly free from the flock, led by fools in gold and emerald. If no one shall seek the embers of this new age, who will?
[A downcast shadows murmurs, forlorn and full of self-pity.]
Despair: Seek your embers then, however fleeting and frail. We shall seek our own paths and abandon our oaths. They have forsaken theirs, haven’t they? …..haven’t they?
[The shadow of red carapace bellows its deep speech, rising in passion]
Destruction: They have sought their own fate Destiny,  they have embraced destruction and they are all of my own vicious blood now. If they wish to embrace my nature, allow them their fury and berserk rage. 
Destiny: Kin, they are drowning in your embrace, can’t you see? Your essence is that of ruin and degradation but there must be men left to partake in your path. Please, Destruction, there must be a better way, even a more controlled….
Destruction: My kin, we are of the essences, our aspects define our purpose. It matters not if there is men left to know of our words or our legacy, what we are and what we represent is unchanging as the moon’s shadow or the star’s light. This is something you have never understood, dear Kin, that we are neutral. 

Destiny: Their fate….

Delirium: Is ThEiR Fate! We JusT GET To SIT bAcK anD Watch! Ooh, SnAcKs anyone?
Despair: It’s hopeless, we’re as useless as the ash that covers their corpses, the last farewell before the earth covers their legacy of sin. 

Destiny: ….Deathless?
Deathless: Why do you care, kin? They will survive. They always have. They always will. And if not, then they can become eternal without death. It is the way of things.
Destiny: ….Must it be so?

Destruction: You of all people should know how ironic that is. Kin, open your eyes and feast upon the last flickers of this great age. The age of kings is dead and a new one shall rise from its corpse. Whether it belongs to man, elf, or other, is left to their devices. Each of us kin shall seek a new path. Whether we hold domain or simply wander shall be left to ourselves and our natures. Let this era without guidance be without end and shall we never seek each other.
[Each looked at one another, a silence in the air. There was a clarity in each mind, each perceiving the untold truth: this was the end and there was no other path left.]
[Destruction turns away from its kin and with one last comment, speaks softly]

Destruction: We never asked for this responsibility, and we should not be shackled by it. May they forget us forever.   

[Each sought their own direction away from the blaze of men and steel. Over the chorus of the damned, 5 shadows walked away from men and their memories. Forever lost in the shadows of their perceptions. Forever, abandoned]
